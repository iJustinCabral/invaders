# Space Invaders Remake

In this proejct I wanted to learn how to draw sprites to the screen using a single tilesheet with Raylib to reduce draw calls. Turns out there is some cool things you can do with #load that loads the data for the image directly into the binary which gives the ability to not need multiple draw calls for different sprites. 

I stopped short on this project because I've started to get bored just recreating older classics. I've already completed Pong, Tetris, Astroids, and Snake and I think it's time for me to experiement with my own tiny, well constrained indie games. I want to keep my motivation high and the way going forward to do that is to focus on protoyping game ideas.

I will continue to move forward with Odin lang as my go to for game development until I can get into the JAI closed beta.
